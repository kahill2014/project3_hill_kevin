			<h1>What's so fun about otters?</h1>
			<section class="facts-section">
				<div id="accordion">
					<h3>Fun Fact #1</h3>
					<div>Thirteen different species of otter exist all around the world. Some are small river otters, and some are bigger sea otters.</div>
					<h3>Fun Fact #2</h3>
					<div>90% of all sea otters live on the coast of Alaska.</div>
					<h3>Fun Fact #3</h3>
					<div>They're hungry animals! Sea otters eat 25% of their body weight in food every day.</div>
					<h3>Fun Fact #4</h3>
					<div>They like to eat sea urchins, clams, mussels and crabs. They use their sea whiskers to find small creatures to eat, and their paws to dig for clams. </div>
					<h3>Fun Fact #5</h3>
					<div>Clever creatures, they'll use rocks to crack open the clams. They carry rocks and store food in the loose skin under their armpits - who needs carrier bags!</div>
					<h3>Fun Fact #6</h3>
					<div>Unlike most marine mammals, they don't have a layer of blubber. But, they do have the thickest fur of all animals.</div>
					<h3>Fun Fact #7</h3>
					<div><strong>Surprise!</strong> No fact here, just a really cute picture of two otters cuddling. Try clicking it! <img id="fun-otters" alt="Picture of two cute otters cuddling" src="../images/cute-otters.jpg" /></div>
					<h3>Fun Fact #8</h3>
					<div>Baby otters are called pups. Newborn pups need lots of attention, and will stay close to their mum's until they've developed enough skills to go it alone - usually at 6 months.</div>
					<h3>Fun Fact #9</h3>
					<div>An otter pup's fur is too dense for it to swim underwater. So, their mother leaves them floating while she searches for food, until their adult fur grows in. </div>
					<h3>Fun Fact #10</h3>
					<div>Don't challenge an otter to a holding-your-breath competition! Sea otters can stay underwater for 5 minutes, and river otters can hold their breath for even longer - 8 minutes! </div>
					<h3>Fun Fact #11</h3>
					<div>Otters like to stick together, so when they sleep they will wrap themselves in seaweed and float together in a group. A group of resting otters is called a raft. We wouldn't go drifting away on one of these rafts, however! Otters have a nasty bite! </div>
